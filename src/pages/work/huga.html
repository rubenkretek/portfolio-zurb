        <h3>Complete overhaul of the brand</h3>
        <p>
          Huga is a Scandinavian-inspired company, so the visual identity needed
          to borrow elements from Danish design. As well as looking good, it
          needed to function well to show potential clients that Huga practice
          what they preach. I created a design that was original, but emanated
          Danish design through simplicity and typography style.

        <h3>Attention to detail</h3>

        <p>
          The old website was rough around the edges and several elements
          appeared broken. The responsive site was difficult to use and seemed
          very cluttered.
        </p>

        <p>
          I streamlined the design and made sure that every little detail
          appeared well finished and well considered. I created a series of
          icons that appear throughout the site, that match the typography and
          other elements on the site, contributing to a cohesive visual
          language.

        <h3>Responsive is key</h3>
        <p>
          The responsiveness of the site needed to look and function as though
          it was purpose built, as opposed to being an afterthought.
        </p>
        <p>
          When building the site, I started from the ground up and always
          considered how the site would work on a variety of devices
        </p>
        <p>
          It was my mission to ensure the site would work equally as well on a
          mobile phone as on a large 4k screen.

        <h3>Technical</h3>
        <p>
          The site was built using PHP, which allowed it to be blazing fast and
          more secure, as it didnâ€™t have a database that could be hacked.
        </p>
        <p>
          The site was hand-coded without using any frameworks, just HTML, CSS,
          JS and PHP. This allowed for total control over how the site
          functioned and taught me a great deal about developing a site with
          pure code.

          The website was just a small part of the project. I was in charge of
          desiging the visual language of the brand as a whole. Other than the
