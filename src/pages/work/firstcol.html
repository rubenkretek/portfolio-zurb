          A built-in jobs board that can be easily managed by FirstCol staff
        </h3>
        <p>
          FirstCol needed their old website to be rebuilt in WordPress, with the
          addition of the ability to add and manage new jobs on offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used an existing plugin as a base for the site’s functionality, and
          customised it to fit FirstCol’s needs.

        <h3>New streamlined application process</h3>

        <p>
          Previously FirstCol took applications through an online form and then
          called applicants to tell them about available jobs.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was able to cut out this step by allowing users to view available
          jobs before applying.

        <h3>UX Review</h3>
        <p>
          I designed the application form to follow a logical layout, and added
          a progress bar and clear instructions alongside each section.

        <h3>Time is money</h3>
        <p>
          FirstCol were experiencing a high rate of drop-offs with their
          previous form, as users were frustrated by the length of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To maximise leads, I added an alternative ‘fast-track’ form, which is
          a stripped back version of the main application form that takes 5
          minutes to complete. This allows FirstCol to still make contact with
          the potential candidate who would otherwise have dropped off.

        <h3>Bespoke WordPress theme</h3>
        <p>
          FirstCol supplied a fresh branding guideline that I used when building
          their new site.
        </p>

        <p>
          This posed many challenges which couldn’t be solved with an
          off-the-shelf theme, so I built a custom one.
        </p>

        <p>
          All job modules on the site needed to appear in a specific way that
          wasn’t present in the plugin or any other theme. I used a combination
          of PHP, CSS and JS to achieve the required layout.

        <h3>Responsive</h3>
        <p>
          A substantial proportion of FirstCol’s traffic came through mobile
          devices, but their old site was not well optimised for smaller
          screens.
        </p>
        <p>
          When desigining and building the website I tested the UX across many
          device types to ensure it functioned effectively.

          I worked closely with FirstCol from the beginning to ensure they would
          be able to use what I built for them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Towards the end of the project I led a workshop at their offices to
          teach them how to use their new system.
