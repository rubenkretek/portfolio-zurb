          My approach to design is minimalistic. I believe it is my duty as a
          designer to make my users think as little as possible, and present
          them with only what they need. This translates into easy to use,
          effective products.

        <p class="text--lead">
          I also follow this mantra when coding, where I try to build things as
          simply as possible. I’m a great believer in doing something properly
          the first time around, so I think carefully about every decision I
          make and imagine what effect it will have in the future.

          Quality work means quality results, which is why I always strive to
          produce the highest quality work. I’m always looking for ways to
          improve and new things to learn, and, having worked on projects for a
          range of industries and clients, I’m ready to take on anything.
